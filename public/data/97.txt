Trevor had spent his entire life working toward a goal of becoming rich. He had the idea that once he was wealthy, all his problems would be solved. He would be happy and secure. He worked incredibly hard, sacrificing everything else in his life. He missed his children growing up. He missed his wife's companionship. He missed his own health and peace of mind. Finally, when Trevor was sixty years old, he achieved wealth. He was very rich. But he was also very alone. His children barely knew him. His wife had moved on. His health was deteriorated from years of stress. Trevor had won the game of making money, but he had lost the game of life. He spent the final years of his life rebuilding relationships with his children and trying to salvage his health. Trevor wished he could go back and tell his younger self that the pursuit of wealth wasn't worth the sacrifice of everything that actually mattered. Money is a tool for living, not the purpose of life. Trevor learned that success without relationships, health, and peace of mind is actually failure dressed up as success.
