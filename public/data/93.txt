Natasha had always been someone who helped others. She was generous with her time and resources. But Natasha realized that she helped others at the expense of her own well-being. She was depleted and exhausted. She had given so much that she had nothing left for herself. Natasha had to make a difficult decision. She had to stop helping in order to save herself. She set boundaries. She said no to requests. She took care of her own needs. Some people were angry that she was no longer as available. But Natasha was no longer depleted. She realized that she could help others better when she was taking care of herself. A person running on empty can't help anyone. But a person with resources can give generously without destroying themselves. Natasha learned that helping others is good, but not at the expense of our own well-being. Sustainable helping requires that we also help ourselves.
