Victor had been a successful businessman, but his business collapsed during an economic downturn. He lost everything: his business, his money, his reputation in his industry. Victor was devastated. He had built his entire identity around being a successful businessman. Without his business, he felt like he was nobody. He went into a depression. He didn't want to see anyone. He was ashamed of his failure. Victor's wife encouraged him to seek therapy. Through therapy, Victor realized something crucial. His worth as a person was not tied to his business success. He was the same person he had always been. He had skills, knowledge, and experience. He had value. Victor decided to start a new business, but this time with a different approach. He had learned from his failures. This business was smaller and more focused. It was slower to grow, but it was sustainable. Victor also realized that he wanted his life to be about more than just making money. He started mentoring young entrepreneurs. He shared his failures and what he had learned. He helped others avoid the mistakes he had made. Victor's second business became successful, but more importantly, Victor became a more balanced and fulfilled person. He learned that failure is not permanent unless we make it permanent. We can always rebuild. We can always learn and grow from our mistakes.
