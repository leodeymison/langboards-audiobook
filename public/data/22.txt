Henry spent his whole life working toward retirement. He saved money, planned his pension, and counted down the days until he could stop working. When retirement finally came, Henry felt empty. He suddenly had nothing to do and nowhere to be. He felt purposeless. The days stretched endlessly. Henry fell into depression. He spent his first year of retirement sitting at home, watching television. But his daughter sat down with him and asked, "What have you always wanted to do that you never had time for?" Henry thought deeply. He remembered that as a young man, he had always wanted to learn woodworking. He had been too busy with his career. Henry decided to take a woodworking class. He was the oldest person in the class, but he was enthusiastic. He discovered that working with wood gave him deep satisfaction. He felt like he was creating something beautiful and meaningful. Henry began making furniture for his family. He started a small business making custom pieces. He made enough money to supplement his pension, but that wasn't why he did it. He did it because it made him feel alive. Henry's retirement became the most fulfilling period of his life. He learned that retirement isn't an ending. It's a new beginning. The key is finding purpose in this new chapter. Purpose and passion can exist at any age.
