Peter had been a successful businessman, but he had been diagnosed with a terminal illness. He had months to live. Peter was devastated, but he also felt clear. He suddenly knew exactly what mattered. Money and status didn't matter. What mattered was his relationships and his legacy. Peter spent his remaining months having deep conversations with the people he loved. He told them what he appreciated about them. He spent time with his grandchildren. He told them stories about his life. He recorded videos for them to watch after he was gone. He wrote letters to be opened on important occasions in their lives. Peter's terminal diagnosis became a gift. It forced him to focus on what actually mattered. His family members treasure the letters and videos he left behind. His words continue to guide them after his death. Peter learned that we don't need to wait until we're dying to live like we're alive. We can live with intention and purpose right now. We can prioritize our relationships and our impact. We can create legacies that outlive us.
