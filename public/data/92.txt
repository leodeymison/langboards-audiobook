Matthew had always believed that happiness was something he would achieve in the future. When he got the job, he would be happy. When he got the house, he would be happy. When he found the right partner, he would be happy. Matthew was always chasing future happiness and missing present happiness. One day, Matthew realized that he had already achieved many of the things he thought would make him happy. He had a good job. He had a decent home. He had a partner who cared about him. But he wasn't happy because he was too busy thinking about the next thing. Matthew made a conscious decision to find happiness in the present. He started noticing small good things in his day. He appreciated his morning coffee. He appreciated time with his partner. He appreciated being able to do work he cared about. Matthew's happiness increased not because his circumstances changed, but because his focus changed. Matthew learned that happiness isn't a destination. It's a practice of noticing and appreciating what we already have.
