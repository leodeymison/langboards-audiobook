Benjamin was a man who had always needed to control everything. He tried to control his children, his wife, his employees, and his circumstances. He was anxious and stressed because he believed that everything depended on him managing every detail perfectly. His family felt suffocated by his control. One day, Benjamin's daughter ran away from home. He was shocked. He thought he had done everything right by controlling every aspect of her life. His daughter left him a letter explaining that she felt like she had no freedom, no autonomy, and no agency in her own life. Benjamin was devastated. He realized that his need to control had driven away the person he loved most. Benjamin had to learn that he couldn't control everything. He couldn't control other people's choices. He couldn't control most of life's circumstances. What he could control was his own choices, his attitude, and his effort. Benjamin apologized to his daughter. He asked for her forgiveness. He gave her the freedom to make her own choices and mistakes. He let go of the need to control his family. It was incredibly difficult for him, but he did it. His daughter came home. They built a new relationship based on mutual respect. Benjamin learned that trying to control everything leads to loss of everything. Letting go is sometimes the only way to keep what we care about.
