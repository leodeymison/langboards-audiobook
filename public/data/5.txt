Marcus was a high school math teacher in a challenging neighborhood. Many people asked him why he didn't choose a better job. His salary was low, and teaching was exhausting. But Marcus had a mission. He believed that education could change lives. He saw himself in his students. He had grown up in similar circumstances, and a teacher had believed in him. Now he wanted to be that teacher for others. Marcus stayed late after school to help struggling students. He visited families who had stopped coming to school. He celebrated every small achievement his students made. Years passed. Many of Marcus's students went to college. Some became doctors, engineers, and teachers themselves. One day, a former student visited his classroom. She was now a surgeon. She told Marcus, "You saved my life. I almost dropped out, but you believed in me when nobody else did." Marcus's eyes filled with tears. In that moment, he understood that his impact on his students was real and lasting. One teacher's belief could transform a life. Marcus continued teaching, knowing his work mattered more than any higher salary ever could.
