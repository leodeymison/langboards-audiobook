Sarah found a love letter hidden in her grandmother's attic. It was written sixty years ago, addressed to her grandmother from someone named James. The letter described passionate emotions and promises of a life together. But Sarah's grandfather was named Thomas, not James. With trembling hands, Sarah decided to ask her grandmother about it. Her grandmother smiled sadly and told the truth. She had been in love with James when she was younger, but he moved away to pursue his dreams. She chose to marry Thomas, a kind and steady man who loved her deeply. Over fifty years together, Thomas became her greatest love. The letter from James was only a fleeting moment in her youth. Sarah's grandmother explained that happiness doesn't come from following the first spark of passion. It comes from choosing to love someone day after day, through all the seasons of life. Sarah understood then that her grandmother had made the right choice, and that choice created the family Sarah was part of.
