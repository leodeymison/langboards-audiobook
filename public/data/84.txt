Michael had spent his entire life trying to prove something. He wasn't sure what, but he knew he was driven by this need. He needed to prove he was worthy. He needed to prove he was capable. He needed to prove he was successful. Michael achieved a lot externally. He had accomplishments and credentials. But none of it satisfied him. The goalpost kept moving. He always needed to achieve more to prove his worth. One day, Michael asked himself, "Prove it to whom?" He realized that he was trying to prove something to people whose opinions didn't actually matter. More importantly, he was trying to prove something to himself, and he was his own harshest critic. Michael made a radical decision. He stopped trying to prove anything. He accepted himself as he was: imperfect, limited, but fundamentally worthy just by existing. He didn't need to achieve more. He needed to accept himself. Michael's peace came from this acceptance. His accomplishments still mattered, but they didn't define his worth. Michael learned that self-acceptance is the end of the exhausting game of trying to prove ourselves.
