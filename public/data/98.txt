Willow had always been waiting for her life to begin. She was waiting for the right person, the right job, the right circumstances. She was in constant preparation mode, getting ready for life rather than actually living. She was in her fifties when she realized something. She had been waiting for forty years. How much longer was she going to wait? Willow made a radical decision. She decided that her life was already happening. She didn't need permission from circumstances to begin living. She started doing the things she had been waiting to do. She traveled alone to places she wanted to see. She took a job doing something meaningful even if it didn't pay as much. She joined groups and made friends. She started living as if her life mattered right now, not at some future date. Willow's life became infinitely richer because she stopped waiting and started living. She learned that the perfect moment will never come. The only moment we have is now. Life happens while we're waiting for it to begin.
