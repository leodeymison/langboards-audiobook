Rachel was a woman who was afraid of being forgotten. She needed constant attention and reassurance from people. She texted excessively. She needed people to respond immediately. She was anxious and demanding in her relationships. This need for constant attention exhausted the people around her. People began to distance themselves from her, which confirmed her worst fear. She was being forgotten. Rachel finally understood that her behavior was pushing people away. She started practicing what would happen if people weren't constantly thinking about her. She realized that being forgotten occasionally is not a tragedy. It's normal. People have their own lives and their own concerns. Their lack of constant attention wasn't a reflection of how much they cared about her. Rachel worked on building a stronger sense of self-worth that wasn't dependent on other people's constant attention. She pursued hobbies and interests that were meaningful to her. She built a fuller life so that she wasn't dependent on other people for her happiness and sense of purpose. Her relationships improved because they were no longer the sole source of her identity. She was able to love people without needing them to prove their love constantly. Rachel learned that the fear of being forgotten often leads to behaviors that actually cause us to be forgotten. It's only when we let go of the need to be constantly remembered that we truly belong.
