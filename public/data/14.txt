Tomas and Miguel had been enemies since they were ten years old. They came from rival families in a small town. Their feud had started over something neither of them could even remember anymore, but it had defined their entire relationship. They avoided each other. If they ran into each other, they glared and walked away. When they grew older, they lived in the same neighborhood but lived separate lives. Then one winter, Miguel's young daughter got lost in a snowstorm. She was only six years old. Miguel was frantic with fear. He searched and searched, but the snow was too heavy to see anything. Then Tomas appeared. Without being asked, Tomas joined the search. He knew the neighborhood well. He searched every possible place. Several hours later, Tomas found the little girl huddled under a bridge. She was alive but very cold. He carried her to her father. Miguel was overwhelmed with gratitude and emotion. Tomas had saved his daughter's life. In that moment, their old feud seemed so meaningless. Miguel invited Tomas to his home. They talked for hours. They realized that they had much more in common than they had differences. They became friends. From that day forward, the two former enemies were inseparable. They regretted all the years they had wasted hating each other. They learned that holding grudges only robs us of meaningful friendships.
