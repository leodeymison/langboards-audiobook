Sophie had been a perfectionist her whole life. Everything had to be perfect: her home, her appearance, her work, her parenting. She spent enormous amounts of time and energy on perfection. But she was miserable. She was never satisfied. She was always stressed about maintaining the perfect image. One day, Sophie's daughter said something that struck her. The daughter said, "Mom, you're so worried about everything being perfect that you're never actually enjoying anything." Sophie realized the truth in those words. She was so focused on the perfect outcome that she was missing the actual experience. Sophie made a change. She stopped aiming for perfection. She aimed for good enough. She painted a wall even though it wasn't perfectly smooth. She went out without perfect makeup. She let her kids make mistakes. She discovered that when she stopped pursuing perfection, she actually started enjoying her life. Sophie learned that perfectionism is a prison. Letting go of perfection is freedom.
