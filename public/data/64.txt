Thomas had been homeless for three years. He had lost his job and his apartment. He had been ashamed and desperate. He had slept on streets and in shelters. He had nearly given up on life. But Thomas was resilient. He went to a shelter that offered job training. He got a job. He saved money. He found an apartment. He rebuilt his life from nothing. Years later, Thomas worked as a counselor for homeless youth. He understood their pain because he had lived it. He knew they weren't lazy or worthless. They were dealing with circumstances beyond their control. Thomas helped young people find housing, get jobs, and rebuild their lives. Because of Thomas's work, many young people didn't stay homeless. They got on their feet and built successful lives. Thomas learned that our darkest moments can become our greatest teachers. When we survive adversity, we gain wisdom that can help others survive the same adversity.
