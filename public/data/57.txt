George was a man who had been a soldier. He had served his country and was proud of his service. But returning to civilian life had been difficult. He struggled with the transition. He didn't know who he was without the military. He didn't know how to find purpose in the civilian world. George felt lost for years. Then he discovered a program that trained soldiers to become teachers in high-poverty schools. George became a teacher. He brought the discipline and mentorship skills he had learned in the military to his classroom. His students responded to his leadership and his care for them. George realized that his purpose wasn't just military service. His purpose was service to others. Teaching allowed him to serve his community and his country in a new way. George spent the rest of his career as a teacher. He made a difference in the lives of thousands of students. His military service had prepared him for this role. George learned that our life's purpose isn't limited to one role or one chapter. We can serve in many different ways throughout our lives.
