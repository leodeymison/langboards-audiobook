Russell had always been conflict avoidant. When there was tension, he would withdraw. He would avoid confrontation. He would let resentment build rather than address issues directly. His relationships suffered because nothing ever got resolved. Russell finally realized that his avoidance wasn't protecting his relationships. It was destroying them. He decided to face conflict instead of avoiding it. He had difficult conversations. He expressed his true feelings instead of pretending everything was fine. Initially, this was terrifying. But his relationships actually improved. When conflicts were addressed, they were resolved. Trust increased because people knew where they stood. Russell learned that conflict is not the enemy of relationships. Unaddressed conflict is the enemy. When we address problems directly and with respect, our relationships actually become stronger.
