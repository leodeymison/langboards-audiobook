Gwen had always blamed her unhappiness on external circumstances. She blamed her childhood for her struggles. She blamed other people for holding her back. She blamed society for her failures. She was a victim of her circumstances. One day, a wise friend asked her, "How long are you going to let your past write your future?" Gwen was shocked by the question. She realized that she was giving away her power. She was using her difficult past as an excuse for her unhappy present. Gwen made the decision to take responsibility for her own life. She couldn't change her past, but she could change her choices in the present. She went to therapy. She worked on healing her trauma. She made different choices. She pursued opportunities. She built a better life. Gwen learned that circumstances affect us, but they don't define us. The people who overcome adversity are those who take responsibility for creating change in their own lives. Victim mentality keeps us stuck. Personal responsibility sets us free.
