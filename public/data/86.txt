Kevin had always lived reactively. Things would happen and he would respond. He didn't plan for the future. He didn't set goals. He just lived day to day. This reactive living meant he was constantly stressed and constantly behind. Then Kevin realized something. He had been avoiding proactive living because it felt like work. But reactive living was also work, and it was stressful work. Kevin decided to try something different. He started planning. He set goals. He took action toward those goals proactively. Initially, it felt difficult and unnatural. But gradually, it became easier. Kevin's life became more aligned with his values. He was moving toward things he actually wanted instead of constantly dealing with crises. Kevin learned that proactive living requires more effort initially, but it creates less stress overall. The time we invest in planning and intention-setting saves us many times that in stress and scrambling.
