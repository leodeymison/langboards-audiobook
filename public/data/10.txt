Keisha had always been athletic. She played soccer, basketball, and ran track in high school. Everyone expected her to become a professional athlete. But Keisha had a secret that she kept hidden for years. She loved mathematics. She spent her free time solving complex equations and thinking about advanced calculus. She was afraid to tell anyone about this secret passion because it didn't fit the image people had of her. Athletic people weren't supposed to love math. When college application time came, Keisha made a choice. She applied to schools for their mathematics programs, not their athletic scholarships. Her coaches were shocked. Her family was concerned. But Keisha knew she had to follow her heart. In college, Keisha studied mathematics intensely. She also joined a recreational soccer team, but she didn't make sports her focus. She discovered that mathematics was her true love. She went on to graduate school and became a mathematics professor. She used her platform to encourage young people, especially girls, to pursue mathematics. She showed them that people can be multifaceted. You don't have to choose just one identity. Keisha became a mentor to many young mathematicians who felt like they didn't fit in. She was so glad she had the courage to be fully herself.
