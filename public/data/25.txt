Jasmine was a young woman with a stutter. She had always had difficulty speaking fluently. Other children had teased her mercilessly growing up. She believed that her stutter made her less intelligent and less worthy. She spoke as little as possible. In high school, Jasmine began to realize that her quiet nature was being interpreted as shyness or lack of intelligence, when really it was shame about her stutter. She made the courageous decision to stop hiding. She joined the debate team. The debate coach was impressed by Jasmine's ideas even though she stumbled over some of her words. The coach told Jasmine that a stutter doesn't diminish the value of her words. What matters is what she has to say. Jasmine worked hard. She prepared extensively for debates so she could speak about topics with deep knowledge. Her stutter didn't disappear, but her fear of it did. She learned to speak anyway, stutter and all. She discovered that audiences weren't bothered by her stutter when she was passionate and knowledgeable. She won several debate competitions. She went to college and became a lawyer. In court, she spoke eloquently for her clients. Some opposing counsel probably thought they could intimidate her because of her stutter. They were wrong. Jasmine's stutter had never made her weak. It had only made her work harder. She learned that our imperfections don't disqualify us from success. They can actually fuel our determination.
