Samuel was a man who had achieved great success as a lawyer. He had a prestigious career and made a lot of money. But he had no relationship with his own children. He had been so focused on his career that he had missed his kids growing up. When his daughter got married, Samuel realized with horror that he didn't actually know his adult children. They had different values. They had different interests. Samuel had missed the entire process of them becoming who they were. Samuel made the most important decision of his life. He stepped back from his career. He reduced his work hours dramatically. He finally had time to really know his children. He learned about their lives, their struggles, their dreams. His relationship with his children gradually deepened. He became the grandfather who actually knew his grandchildren. Years later, at Samuel's funeral, his children didn't talk about his professional achievements. They talked about how much they loved him and how much he meant to them. Samuel learned that career achievements are forgotten. But relationships last forever. The success that actually matters is the relationships we build with the people we love.
