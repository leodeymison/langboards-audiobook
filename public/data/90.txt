Christopher had always been someone who needed to be in control. He needed to know what was happening and have a plan. Uncertainty made him very anxious. One year, Christopher faced major uncertainty. His job became unstable. His relationship became shaky. He couldn't control any of it. Christopher realized he had two choices. He could spend his time anxiously trying to regain control, or he could accept the uncertainty and adapt as things unfolded. Christopher chose adaptation. He prepared for multiple possible futures instead of trying to guarantee one specific future. He became more flexible. When things changed, he changed with them. Christopher's peace increased because he was no longer trying to do the impossible. He was doing the possible: preparing, adapting, and responding. Christopher learned that we cannot control most things in life. What we can control is our response. Flexibility and adaptation are more powerful than control.
