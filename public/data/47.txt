Diane had always been the perfect daughter. She was obedient. She met her parents' expectations. She became a doctor as they had wanted. She married a man they approved of. She had children and provided them with every advantage. But in middle age, Diane realized she was living her parents' dream, not her own. She had never asked herself what she actually wanted. She felt empty and unfulfilled. Diane's therapist asked her, "Who are you when nobody's watching? What brings you joy?" Diane couldn't answer these questions. She had no identity separate from her roles and expectations. Diane made the courageous decision to reclaim her own life. She started doing things that interested her, even though her parents disapproved. She took an art class. She traveled to places her parents wouldn't have approved of. She questioned beliefs she had been taught to accept without thinking. Her parents were upset with her rebellion. But Diane's life became her own. She discovered who she actually was. She discovered what actually made her happy. When her parents eventually passed away, Diane realized that she would never have to live another day for them. She could fully be herself. Diane learned that honoring our parents doesn't mean erasing ourselves. It means respectfully choosing our own path.
