Fiona had always been afraid of failure, so she never tried anything difficult. She never attempted things that might fail. She played it safe. But living safely meant she never experienced success either. She never accomplished anything meaningful because she never attempted anything meaningful. Fiona's fear of failure had made her life very small. One day, Fiona decided that she was more afraid of a small life than she was afraid of failure. She attempted something difficult. She failed. And she survived the failure. It wasn't as catastrophic as she had feared. She tried something else. She failed at that too. But she also tried again, and eventually she succeeded. Fiona realized that failure was necessary for success. She couldn't achieve without risking failure. Fiona's life expanded because she was willing to fail. Fiona learned that our fear of failure often keeps us from the very success we desire. The path to success goes through failure.
