Liam had suffered a traumatic brain injury that left him with a stutter and cognitive challenges. He had been a successful businessman before his injury. After his injury, he had to relearn how to do everything. His recovery took years. But Liam persevered. He worked with speech therapists and occupational therapists. He recovered much of his function. He went back to work in a different role that played to his strengths. He became an advocate for brain injury survivors. He shared his story to help others understand what people with brain injuries go through. He founded an organization that helped brain injury survivors receive proper therapy and support. Liam learned that injury doesn't have to be the end. It can be a new beginning. Our resilience and our determination matter more than our circumstances.
