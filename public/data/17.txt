Patricia was a woman who had been told her entire life that she was too loud. Teachers told her to be quiet in school. Colleagues told her to speak less in meetings. Her husband told her that her opinions were too strong. Patricia learned to shrink herself. She made herself smaller so others would be comfortable. She stopped sharing her ideas. She became quiet and invisible. Years of silence led to depression. Patricia felt like she was disappearing. She went to therapy and finally began to understand that her loud voice wasn't a flaw. It was a gift. She had always had strong ideas and powerful opinions because she cared deeply about the world. She had been silenced, not because something was wrong with her, but because her voice challenged the status quo. Patricia made a decision. She started speaking again. She shared her ideas in meetings. She wrote about topics she cared about. She used her voice to advocate for causes she believed in. Not everyone liked her more vocal self. Some people distanced themselves from her. But others were drawn to her authenticity. Patricia found her tribe: people who valued her honesty and her passion. She realized that she had spent decades trying to be someone she wasn't. When she finally became herself, she felt alive. Patricia learned that trying to be small for the comfort of others only makes us feel small.
