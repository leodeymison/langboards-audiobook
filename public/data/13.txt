Grandmother Rose had been married to Grandfather James for sixty years. She had given him her whole life. She had raised children, kept their home, supported his career, and asked for very little in return. As she aged, Rose felt invisible. She believed her life had been unremarkable. Then James became ill with a serious condition. He had to go to the hospital. While he was there, people came to visit. His colleagues came. His children came. His grandchildren came. But more surprisingly, people Rose didn't expect appeared. Nurses who had helped Rose over the years came. Neighbors whom Rose had quietly helped came. A young woman came and explained that Rose had mentored her years ago, and that mentorship had changed her life trajectory. Person after person shared stories of how Rose had made a difference in their lives. Rose had been so focused on serving her family that she hadn't noticed the ripple of positive impact she created everywhere she went. That hospital room became a celebration of her life. Rose realized that her life had been extraordinary, not because of grand achievements, but because of the small acts of kindness and love she gave every single day.
