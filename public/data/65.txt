Rebecca had suffered a serious car accident that left her partially paralyzed. She had to relearn how to walk. She had to adapt to a new life with disabilities. Rebecca was angry and depressed. She went through a long period of grief for the life she had lost. But slowly, Rebecca began to accept her new reality. She worked with physical therapists. She learned adaptive strategies. She became an advocate for disability rights. She started a support group for people who had recently become disabled. She showed them that life doesn't end after a life-changing injury. It changes, but it can still be meaningful and full. Rebecca became more fulfilled in her life after her injury than she had been before. She found her purpose. She was helping others navigate trauma. Rebecca learned that we're capable of far more resilience than we ever imagined. When we're forced to adapt, we often discover inner strength we didn't know we had.
