Antoine had been addicted to drugs for ten years. He had lost everything: his job, his family, his dignity. He had been homeless and desperate. He hit rock bottom. In that moment of complete despair, Antoine reached out for help. He went to treatment. He went through withdrawal. He worked a twelve-step program. He slowly rebuilt his life. Years later, Antoine had been sober for fifteen years. He had a good job. He had rebuilt his relationship with his family. He had a new family of his own. He became a counselor for people struggling with addiction. He knew their pain intimately. He knew their desperation. He knew their shame. He helped people believe that recovery was possible because he had done it. Antoine's work saved lives. People who would have died from addiction survived because Antoine believed in them. Antoine learned that our lowest point doesn't have to define our life. We can recover. We can rebuild. We can use our recovery to help others recover.
