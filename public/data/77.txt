Patricia had suffered a loss that she thought would destroy her. Her young son had died in an accident. The grief was unbearable. Patricia wanted to die too. She didn't want to live in a world where her son didn't exist. But Patricia had other children who needed her. She had a responsibility to live. So Patricia learned to carry her grief. She didn't try to get over it or move past it. She learned to live with it. She started a foundation in her son's name to prevent the type of accident that killed him. She worked tirelessly to make sure his death had meaning. She helped other families who had experienced similar losses. She became known as a voice for safety and prevention. Patricia's grief never went away, but it became purposeful. She learned that loss is permanent, but it doesn't have to be destructive. We can transform our grief into legacy and meaning.
