Jessica had survived cancer. She had gone through chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery. She had nearly died. But she survived. After her recovery, Jessica felt like she had been given a second chance. She began to live differently. She quit her job that made her miserable. She spent more time with friends and family. She traveled. She started a blog about her cancer journey to help others. She became involved in cancer research funding. Jessica realized that her cancer, as terrible as it was, had given her something. It had given her clarity about what mattered. She had learned to appreciate her life in a way she never would have learned otherwise. She had become an advocate and a voice for cancer survivors. Jessica's impact extended far beyond her own recovery. She inspired thousands of people. She helped raise millions for cancer research. She changed laws about cancer patient care. Jessica learned that sometimes our greatest pain becomes our greatest purpose.
