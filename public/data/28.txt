Thomas was a shy man who had always been afraid of rejection. He had fallen in love with his best friend, Alexandra, but he had never told her. He was terrified that telling her would ruin their friendship. So he kept silent for five years while watching her date other people. His friends finally confronted him and asked why he was living in fear instead of actually living. They asked him which was worse: risking rejection or living with regret forever. Thomas thought about this deeply. He realized that he was already suffering. At least if he told her the truth, he might get the chance to be happy. One evening, Thomas asked Alexandra to sit down with him. His hands were shaking. His voice was shaky. He told her that he had fallen in love with her and had been in love with her for years. He told her that he understood if she didn't feel the same way, and he didn't want to lose her friendship. Alexandra was quiet for a long moment. Then she said, "I've been waiting for you to say that." She had been in love with him too, but she had been waiting for him to make a move. They got together that day. They got married two years later. Thomas realized that his fear had almost cost him the most important relationship of his life. He learned that the risk of rejection is worth taking when something truly matters to us.
