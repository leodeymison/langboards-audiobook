Lily had grown up in a culture of shame. Anything that went wrong was seen as a personal failure to be hidden and ashamed of. Lily had internalized this shame. When bad things happened to her, she blamed herself. She felt ashamed. She tried to hide her struggles. This shame kept her isolated and prevented her from getting help. As an adult, Lily learned about the difference between shame and guilt. Guilt is "I did something bad." Shame is "I am bad." Lily realized that she had been living with destructive shame. She had survived childhood trauma, but she had taken on shame about something that wasn't her fault. Through therapy, Lily released her shame. She spoke her truth. She connected with others who had similar experiences. She realized that her suffering wasn't a character flaw. It was just suffering, and it was survivable. By sharing her story, she helped others release their shame too. Lily learned that shame thrives in silence. Truth and connection are its antidote. We don't have to carry our pain alone. When we share it, we heal.
