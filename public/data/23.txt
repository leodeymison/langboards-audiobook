Rachel was terrified of public speaking. The thought of standing in front of an audience made her hands shake and her mind go blank. She had avoided any situation that required her to speak publicly. Her job as a project manager became limited because she couldn't present to clients. Rachel's boss suggested that she take a public speaking class. Rachel's first instinct was to say no. But she was tired of letting her fear control her life. She enrolled in the class. The first session was terrifying. When it was her turn to speak, she felt paralyzed. She forgot what she wanted to say. Her voice shook. She looked at the audience's faces and wanted to run out of the room. But she finished her speech. She had done it. The audience applauded. No one had laughed or judged her harshly. Over weeks, Rachel practiced speaking. Each time, it got slightly easier. She learned techniques to calm her nerves. She discovered that other people were also nervous about speaking. She wasn't alone in her fear. After completing the class, Rachel volunteered to give a presentation to important clients at her work. She was still nervous, but she was no longer paralyzed by fear. She gave an excellent presentation. She got the client contract. Her boss praised her confidence. Rachel realized that courage isn't the absence of fear. It's doing the thing you're afraid of despite the fear. Every time she did it, the fear lost a little bit of its power.
