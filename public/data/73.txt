Claire had always been afraid of taking risks. She played it safe her entire life. She stayed in relationships that didn't fulfill her. She stayed in jobs she didn't enjoy. She didn't pursue her dreams because she was afraid of failure. By the time Claire was sixty years old, she was filled with regret. She realized that she had wasted her life playing it safe. She had never taken the risks that might have brought her joy. Claire made the decision that she would not spend her remaining years with the same regrets. She left her unfulfilling marriage. She quit her job. She went back to school to study art, something she had always wanted to do. She took risks. Some of them didn't work out. But some of them did. Claire spent her final decades doing things that made her feel alive. She had an art show that was successful. She traveled. She had adventures. She became a mentor to young artists. Claire learned that the risk of failure is nothing compared to the certainty of regret. It's never too late to start living boldly.
