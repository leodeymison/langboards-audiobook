Thomas grew up in a small town where everyone worked in factories. His parents wanted him to get a stable job like everyone else. But Thomas had always dreamed of becoming a pilot. He watched planes fly over their town and imagined himself in the cockpit. His friends laughed at his dream. "That's not for people like us," they said. Thomas worked hard anyway. He took extra jobs to save money for flight school. When he was eighteen, he left his town. His parents were disappointed, but Thomas knew he had to follow his heart. Flight school was difficult. There were moments when he wanted to quit. But he remembered why he started. He remembered those planes flying over the small town. Thomas became a pilot at twenty-five. His first flight as captain was unforgettable. Years later, when he flew over his hometown, he could see the factories below. He was grateful for his humble beginnings, but even more grateful that he had the courage to chase his dream. He often thought about that boy who looked up at the sky and believed he could fly. He was so glad that boy never gave up.
