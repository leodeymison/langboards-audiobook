Robert had been estranged from his son for fifteen years. They had a terrible fight over his son's life choices. Robert couldn't accept the person his son wanted to be. So his son left, and they didn't speak for years. Robert missed his son every single day. He missed knowing what was happening in his son's life. He missed his grandchildren growing up. One day, Robert realized that his pride had cost him everything that mattered. He picked up the phone and called his son. He said, "I'm sorry. I was wrong. I want to know you. I want to know my grandchildren. I don't care anymore what your life looks like. I just want to be part of it." His son was shocked. But he was also ready to forgive. They began rebuilding their relationship. It was awkward at first, but they were trying. Years later, when Robert was dying, his son was at his bedside. He told his son, "I wasted so many years. Don't make my mistake. Don't let pride keep you from the people you love." His son promised he wouldn't. Robert died, and his son made sure that his father's wisdom wasn't wasted. He worked on his relationships constantly. He didn't let small disagreements turn into years of estrangement. Robert's regret became his son's greatest teacher. Robert learned that life is too short to hold grudges against the people we love. Forgiveness is always possible if we're brave enough to seek it.
