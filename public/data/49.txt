Eleanor had grown up in poverty. Her mother had worked multiple jobs to provide for her and her siblings. Eleanor never forgot the sacrifice her mother made. As an adult, Eleanor became successful and wealthy. The first thing she did was bring her mother to live with her. She provided her mother with comfort and security. She spent hours listening to her mother's stories about their difficult past. But her mother never spoke about her sacrifice. She never said, "Look what I did for you." Instead, Eleanor's mother was grateful for the comfort she now had. She was happy that her children had grown up and found success. She didn't expect gratitude for what she had done. She had done it out of love. Eleanor understood that her mother's greatest legacy wasn't the sacrifice. It was the example of unconditional love and selflessness. Eleanor lived her life trying to emulate her mother's character. When Eleanor had children, she told them stories about her mother's strength. She made sure her mother's legacy lived on not just in genetics, but in values and character. Eleanor learned that the most important inheritance we can leave isn't money or status. It's the values and character traits we model for the next generation.
