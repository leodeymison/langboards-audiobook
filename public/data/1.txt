Mike always wore the same faded blue hoody every single day. His coworkers whispered about it, making assumptions about his life. They thought he was careless or poor. But nobody knew the real story. That hoody was a gift from his late grandmother, and wearing it made him feel close to her. Years ago, when he was struggling with depression, she gave it to him and said, "This hoody will keep you warm, not just on cold days, but on the cold days of your heart." After she passed away, Mike made a decision. He chose to wear it proudly, regardless of what others thought. One day, a colleague approached him and asked about the hoody. Mike shared the story. Tears filled the colleague's eyes. From that day forward, everyone in the office began to understand that appearances are not what define a person. Each item we carry tells a story of love and meaning. Mike learned that staying true to what matters is more important than fitting in with others.
