Victoria had lived a very structured life. She woke at the same time every day. She ate the same meals. She followed the same routine. Structure had given her stability and control. But it had also made her life rigid and boring. One day, Victoria decided to do something unstructured. She took the day off work without a plan. She went where she wanted to go. She did what she felt like doing. She was amazed at how alive she felt. She discovered things she never would have discovered if she had been following her normal routine. Victoria began to incorporate more spontaneity into her life while still maintaining the structure she needed. She found balance between planning and spontaneity. Her life became both stable and exciting. Victoria learned that structure is good, but structure with no flexibility is prison. The most fulfilling lives have both structure and spontaneity.
