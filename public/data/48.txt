Anthony was a man who had lived his entire life trying to live up to his father's legacy. His father had been a war hero. He was famous and revered. Anthony felt enormous pressure to be as impressive as his father. He joined the military like his father. He dedicated his life to being a hero like his father. But Anthony wasn't like his father. He wasn't interested in the things his father was interested in. He wasn't good at the things his father was good at. Anthony felt like a failure constantly because he was trying to be someone he wasn't. One day, Anthony's father visited him. His father told him something that changed everything. He said, "Son, I never wanted you to be like me. I wanted you to be yourself. Your job isn't to replicate my life. Your job is to live your own life authentically. That's what I'm proud of." Those words freed Anthony. He left the military. He pursued his actual interests. He became a teacher, something his father never would have expected. He was happy. He was fulfilled. He was himself. His father was proud of him not because he was like his father, but because he was truly himself. Anthony learned that the greatest gift we can give our children isn't an example to follow. It's permission to be themselves.
