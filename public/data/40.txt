Michael was a man who lived in constant comparison. He was always measuring himself against others. Was he smarter? More successful? More attractive? This constant comparison made him miserable because there was always someone doing better than him. He felt like he was never enough. One day, Michael realized something important. He was comparing his inside to everyone else's outside. He was painfully aware of his own struggles, doubts, and insecurities. But he was only seeing other people's public success and appearance. He wasn't seeing their struggles. He was creating an impossible standard of comparison. Michael started unfollowing social media accounts that made him feel bad about himself. He stopped asking people to prove their accomplishments. He stopped comparing his beginning to someone else's middle. He started noticing his own progress instead of obsessing about how far he still had to go. Michael's sense of well-being improved dramatically. He was able to appreciate his own life. He was able to be happy when other people succeeded instead of feeling envious. Michael learned that comparison is the thief of joy. The person we should be competing against is the person we were yesterday.
