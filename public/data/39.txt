Sophia was a woman who was very critical of others. She judged people harshly. She pointed out their flaws and mistakes. She believed she was being helpful by pointing out how they could improve. But people avoided her. Nobody wanted to spend time with her because she made them feel bad about themselves. One day, someone finally told Sophia what everyone was thinking. They said, "Your criticism makes us feel worthless. We don't need a critic. We need a friend." Sophia was shocked. She hadn't realized the impact of her constant criticism. She had been taught to notice flaws as a way to help people improve. But her approach was actually tearing people down instead of building them up. Sophia made a conscious effort to change. She started noticing people's strengths instead of their weaknesses. She expressed appreciation instead of criticism. When she felt the urge to criticize, she asked herself, "Is this necessary? Is it kind? Is it helpful?" Usually, the answer was no. Sophia's relationships transformed. People wanted to spend time with her now. She became someone who made people feel good about themselves. Sophia learned that criticism may sometimes be necessary, but encouragement and appreciation are always more powerful.
