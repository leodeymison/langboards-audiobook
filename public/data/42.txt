William was a man who held onto grudges. He had been hurt by people in the past, and he couldn't forgive them. He replayed the hurt over and over in his mind. He told stories about how people had wronged him. This constant rehashing of past hurts kept him stuck in pain. One day, William's therapist asked him, "How is holding onto this grudge helping you?" William realized that it wasn't helping him. Holding onto the grudge was like drinking poison and expecting the other person to get sick. The person who had hurt him had probably moved on and was living their life. But William was still suffering. William decided to forgive. Forgiveness didn't mean that what happened was okay. It meant that he was choosing not to let past hurts define his future. William let go of the stories he had been telling himself about how he had been victimized. He acknowledged the hurt, and then he released it. His life changed. He had more peace. He had more energy because he wasn't spending it on resentment. He could actually feel happy again. William learned that forgiveness is not for the other person. It's for ourselves. It's the only way to be free from our past.
