Amara had experienced systemic racism her entire life. She had been discriminated against repeatedly because of her race. She had been rejected for jobs, housing, and opportunities because of the color of her skin. The pain and injustice of this reality could have destroyed her. But Amara channeled her pain into action. She became an activist for racial justice. She worked to expose systemic racism. She advocated for policy changes. She mentored young people of color. She showed them how to navigate a world that was biased against them. She gave them tools to succeed despite the barriers. Amara's work contributed to real change. Laws were changed. Discriminatory practices were exposed and stopped. Young people were empowered. Amara learned that facing injustice can either break us or fuel us to fight for change. She chose to fight. Her resilience became her power.
