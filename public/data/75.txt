Natalie had lived her entire life trying to be someone she wasn't. She had pretended to be interested in things that didn't interest her. She had hidden her true opinions and beliefs. She had tried to be likeable and acceptable. She had prioritized others' approval over her own authenticity. In her fifties, Natalie finally stopped caring what people thought. She started being honest. She shared her real opinions. She did things that interested her, even if others thought they were strange. She was loud and opinionated. She didn't apologize for being herself. Some people didn't like the new Natalie. But the people who mattered loved her more because she was finally real. Her children were amazed to finally know their real mother. Her friends felt like they could finally be honest too. Natalie's authenticity gave others permission to be authentic. Natalie learned that trying to please everyone pleases no one, including ourselves. Our true power lies in being authentically ourselves.
