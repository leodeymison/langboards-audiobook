Maria was the oldest of six children. She had taken on the role of second mother to her younger siblings when their own mother had become ill. Maria sacrificed her own childhood to raise her siblings. She didn't go to college. She didn't pursue her dreams. She stayed home and took care of the family. Her siblings grew up and moved away. They became successful. But Maria always felt like her potential had been sacrificed for her family. She had resentment toward her siblings for having opportunities she never had. Years later, Maria's youngest brother became very sick. He asked for Maria specifically. Maria sat by his bedside. He told her, "You saved my life. You gave me a safe home when Mama couldn't. I became who I am because of you. My success is because of what you did for me." All of Maria's siblings said similar things. They explained that Maria's sacrifice had made their entire lives possible. Maria finally understood the value of what she had done. She had thought of it as a loss. But it had actually been her greatest contribution. Maria wrote a memoir about her experiences. She became a mentor to other young people who were caregivers. She taught them that caregiving, though difficult, is one of the most important roles a person can have. Maria learned that some of the most valuable contributions we make aren't recognized in real time. But that doesn't make them any less important.
