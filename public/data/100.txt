Yolanda had always been people-pleaser. She could not bear the thought of anyone being disappointed with her. She said yes to everything. She bent herself into whatever shape people needed her to be. She had no idea who she actually was. One day, Yolanda realized that trying to please everyone was an impossible task. Someone would always be disappointed. She couldn't be all things to all people. The thought was liberating. Yolanda started saying no. She started being honest about her limitations. She started being herself instead of trying to be who she thought people wanted her to be. Some people were upset. Some people distanced themselves. But Yolanda discovered something unexpected. The people who stayed were people who loved her for who she actually was. Her relationships became deeper because they were based on authenticity instead of performance. Yolanda learned that trying to please everyone doesn't win friends. It loses your self. When we finally stop performing and start being, we finally start living.
