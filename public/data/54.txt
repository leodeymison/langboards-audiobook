Margaret was a woman who had always been told she was selfish for not wanting children. In her culture and her family, a woman's primary purpose was to be a mother. Margaret didn't feel called to motherhood, but she felt tremendous pressure to conform. She had always wanted to study marine biology and work to protect the ocean. She had always wanted to travel and have adventures. She had always wanted to focus on her own development and interests. Margaret finally decided to listen to her own voice instead of the voices of others. She pursued marine biology. She didn't have children. She traveled extensively. She had adventures. She lived her life according to her own values and desires. Her family was disappointed at first. But over time, they saw how happy and fulfilled Margaret was. They saw that her work was important. She was making a difference in ocean conservation. They began to respect her choices. Margaret never had regrets about not having children. She had a full, meaningful life. She became a mentor to young women who also felt called to things other than motherhood. She showed them that there were many ways to have a meaningful life. Margaret learned that respecting our own calling is just as important as respecting the callings of others. We each have our own unique purpose.
