Elena was a woman who always had to be right. She argued with everyone about everything. She had to prove that she was smarter, more capable, and more knowledgeable than everyone else. This need to be right pushed people away from her. She had very few friends. Her relationships were shallow because nobody could truly relax around her. Then Elena's best friend confronted her. She said, "Being right isn't more important than being happy. You're so focused on proving that you're right that you're losing the people who care about you." Elena was devastated. She realized that her need to be right was a defense mechanism. She had learned as a child that being smart and right was the only way to be valued. So she had spent her adult life proving her worth through intellectual dominance. Elena started therapy. She worked on accepting that she didn't always have to be right. She learned to listen to other people's perspectives without immediately arguing. She learned to be curious instead of defensive. Her relationships deepened dramatically. People felt safe around her now. She had made real friends. Elena learned that being right is less important than being in right relationship with others. The need to win every argument costs us far more than it gains.
