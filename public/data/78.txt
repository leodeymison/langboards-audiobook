Frederick had always been competitive. He had always needed to be the best, the strongest, the smartest. He had pushed himself and others relentlessly. He had very few friends because his competitiveness exhausted people. He had stress-related health problems. One day, Frederick had a heart attack. He nearly died. In the hospital, Frederick had a moment of clarity. He realized that he was dying, and nobody cared if he had won or succeeded. What they cared about was whether he had loved them and been present with them. Frederick made changes. He stopped trying to be the best. He started being kind. He started being present. He apologized to people he had harmed with his competitiveness. Some people forgave him. Some didn't. But Frederick felt so much lighter. His blood pressure came down. His health improved. He made friends. Frederick learned that winning at everything means losing the things that matter. True success is measured in relationships and peace, not in achievement and dominance.
