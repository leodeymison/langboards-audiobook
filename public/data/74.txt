Edwin had lived a life focused on acquiring things. He had worked hard to accumulate wealth, possessions, and status. He had a large house, expensive cars, and exclusive memberships. But he had never felt satisfied. He always wanted more. One day, Edwin traveled to a small village in a developing country. The people there had very little money, but they had something he lacked: community and contentment. They spent time together. They celebrated life's moments together. They didn't compare themselves to each other. Edwin spent three months in the village. He helped build a school. He spent time with families. He learned their language. He experienced a life so different from his own. When Edwin returned home, his large house felt oppressive. His possessions felt burdensome. He started giving things away. He sold his house and moved to a smaller place. He quit his job that required him to work sixty hours a week. He started a business that made him less money but gave him more time. He spent that time with family and friends. He found contentment. Edwin learned that happiness isn't about having more. It's about having enough and knowing the difference. It's about prioritizing people over possessions.
