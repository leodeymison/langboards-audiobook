Catherine spent her whole life trying to please everyone else. She said yes to every request. She put everyone's needs before her own. She believed that being selfish was the worst thing a person could be. So she sacrificed her own well-being for the sake of others. By middle age, Catherine was exhausted and bitter. She resented the people she had sacrificed for because she felt unappreciated. She had given so much and received so little in return. Catherine finally went to therapy. Her therapist asked her, "If you don't take care of yourself, how can you take care of anyone else?" Catherine had never thought about it that way. She realized that by neglecting her own needs, she was actually harming everyone who depended on her. If she was exhausted and resentful, she couldn't give anyone her best self. Catherine started saying no. She set boundaries. She prioritized her own health and well-being. Initially, she felt guilty. Some people were angry that she was no longer saying yes to everything. But gradually, Catherine felt better. She had more energy. She was happier. When she did help people, it came from a place of genuine desire to help, not obligation. Her relationships actually improved. People respected her more because she respected herself. Catherine learned that taking care of yourself is not selfish. It's essential.
