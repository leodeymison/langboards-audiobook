Anna and her father hadn't spoken in five years. Their relationship had broken after a serious argument about Anna's career choices. Her father wanted her to become a lawyer. Anna wanted to be an artist. They both said things they deeply regretted. The silence between them grew into a wall that seemed impossible to break. Years passed. Anna's art career was modest but fulfilling. One day, Anna received news that her father had fallen ill. His health was declining. Anna was afraid she would lose him without ever reconciling. She made the difficult decision to visit him. When she arrived at his hospital room, her father cried. He had been waiting for her. He told her that he was sorry for not supporting her dreams. He said that watching her art from a distance had shown him how talented she was. He was so proud of her. They spent hours talking, healing their years of separation. Anna's father recovered. Their relationship was rebuilt, stronger than before. They both learned that pride and stubbornness can poison our most important relationships. It's never too late to say sorry and rebuild what was broken.
