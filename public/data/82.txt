Jack had lived a good life, but he had always been someone who played the role that was expected of him. He was a good son, a good employee, a good husband, a good father. He had done what was expected. But he had never done what he wanted. He had never allowed himself to be self-indulgent or selfish, even in small ways. Near the end of his life, Jack realized that he had no regrets about being responsible and meeting his obligations. But he did regret that he had never allowed himself simple pleasures just for the sake of enjoyment. He had never traveled just for fun. He had never spent money on something purely for his own joy. He had never pursued interests that didn't benefit anyone else. Jack's final years were different. He took trips. He bought things that made him happy. He spent time doing things he enjoyed. His family wasn't upset by this change. They were happy to see him finally enjoying himself. Jack learned that taking care of others is important, but taking care of ourselves is equally important. Life isn't meant to be only duty and obligation. It's also meant to include joy and pleasure. A balanced life includes both responsibility to others and kindness to ourselves.
