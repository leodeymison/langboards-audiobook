Henry had written a letter to his daughter that he wanted to be opened after his death. In that letter, Henry shared all the things he had never been able to tell her in person. He told her about his struggles and his fears. He told her how proud he was of her. He told her about the times he had failed as a father and how sorry he was. He told her that he loved her unconditionally. When Henry died, his daughter opened the letter. She cried as she read it. She had always thought her father was disappointed in her. She had always felt like she wasn't good enough. But the letter revealed a father who loved her deeply and was proud of her. His letter gave her permission to let go of her shame and accept his love. Henry's letter became a cherished possession. His daughter read it over and over, especially during difficult times. His words comforted her. She eventually shared his letter with her own children to teach them about the importance of expressing love while we still have the chance. Henry learned that it's never too late to tell people we love them, but it's better not to wait until after we're gone.
