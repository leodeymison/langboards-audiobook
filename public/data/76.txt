Oscar had grown up in a household where emotions were never discussed. He had learned to suppress his feelings. He kept everything bottled up inside. As an adult, he was successful professionally, but emotionally disconnected. His relationships were shallow. He couldn't access his own emotions. One day, Oscar's daughter asked him, "Do you love me?" Oscar answered, "Of course I love you." His daughter replied, "How do I know if you never show it?" Oscar was shocked. He realized that his emotional suppression was affecting his relationships. He started therapy. He learned to identify and express his emotions. He learned to cry. He learned to laugh freely. He became a more present and engaged father. His relationships deepened. Oscar learned that emotions aren't weakness. They're essential to being human. Suppressing them doesn't make us stronger. It makes us emptier. Feeling our emotions fully makes us whole.
