David had lived his entire life with anxiety. He was anxious about the future. He was anxious about what other people thought. He was anxious about health, money, relationships. Anxiety was his constant companion. David tried many things to eliminate his anxiety. But nothing worked. Then David's therapist asked him something different. Instead of asking how to eliminate anxiety, she asked, "What if anxiety isn't the problem? What if anxiety is just your mind trying to protect you? What if you could feel anxious and still do the things that matter?" This reframing changed everything. David stopped fighting his anxiety. He acknowledged it. He accepted it. And then he did things despite feeling anxious. He went on dates even though he was anxious. He pursued his career even though he was anxious. He took risks even though he was anxious. His life expanded because he was no longer waiting until the anxiety went away before living. David learned that we don't have to feel completely comfortable to take action. We can feel anxious and still move forward. Comfort is not a prerequisite for growth.
