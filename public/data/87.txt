Angela had suffered a serious setback in her career. She had been passed over for a promotion in favor of someone less qualified. She had felt humiliated and unfairly treated. She was tempted to quit. But Angela did something different. She asked for feedback. She learned what skills she needed to develop. She didn't become bitter. She became better. She worked on developing the skills she lacked. She pursued additional training. She built stronger relationships with colleagues. Two years later, Angela got an even better position than the one she had missed. She realized that the initial rejection had been a gift because it had forced her to grow. Angela learned that setbacks aren't failures. They're redirections. Sometimes we don't get what we want because we're not ready. When we use the time to improve ourselves, we eventually get something even better.
