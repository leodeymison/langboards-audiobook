Charles had been a corporate executive for thirty years. He had climbed the corporate ladder. He had power and prestige. But he had done things he wasn't proud of. He had prioritized profit over people. He had laid off workers to maximize shareholder value. He had made decisions that harmed communities. As Charles aged, he felt more and more uncomfortable with his legacy. He asked himself, "When I die, what do I want to be remembered for? Do I want to be remembered for the money I made and the power I had?" The answer was no. Charles used his wealth and his platform to make amends. He funded education programs in communities his company had exploited. He advocated for corporate responsibility and ethical business practices. He mentored young businesspeople about the importance of values in business. Charles's later years were more fulfilling than his executive years had been. He spent his time trying to counterbalance the harm he had caused. He learned that it's never too late to change course and try to make things right. Legacy isn't about how successful you were. It's about the impact you had and whether that impact was positive.
