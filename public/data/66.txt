Marcus had grown up in a gang-infested neighborhood. He had lost friends to violence. He had been tempted to join a gang himself. It seemed like the only way to survive. But Marcus had a teacher who believed in him. That teacher gave him a scholarship to a private school. Marcus left his neighborhood for school. He got a good education. He went to college. He got a job. He escaped the cycle of poverty and violence that had seemed inescapable. As an adult, Marcus went back to his neighborhood. He started a youth center. He became the teacher for other kids like he had been. He gave them what his teacher had given him: belief in their potential. Marcus's youth center saved lives. Kids who would have joined gangs got involved in positive activities instead. Kids who would have dropped out of school stayed in school. Marcus became a hero in his community. He learned that one person's belief in you can change your entire trajectory. Now he was that person for others.
