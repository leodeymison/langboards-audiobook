Xavier had always been an anxious person. He worried about everything: what could go wrong, what people might think, what the future might hold. His anxiety consumed him. He spent so much mental energy worrying that he had very little left for living. Xavier finally decided to challenge his anxiety. When he noticed himself worrying, he asked himself, "Is this worry helping me right now? Is it changing the situation?" Usually, the answer was no. He was worrying about things beyond his control. Xavier learned a practice of acceptance. He accepted that he couldn't control many things in life. He could only control his effort and his attitude. When he released the need to worry about uncontrollable things and focused on what he could control, his anxiety decreased dramatically. His life improved not because his circumstances changed, but because his relationship with his circumstances changed. Xavier learned that anxiety is like paying interest on debt you haven't incurred yet. Most of what we worry about never happens.
