Aaron had always blamed his parents for his problems. His childhood was difficult, and he believed that his parents' mistakes had created all his problems. He was angry at them. This anger kept him stuck. He wasn't moving forward because he was too busy being angry at the past. One day, Aaron realized that he was an adult now. His parents' actions were in the past, and he couldn't change them. But he could change his response to them. Aaron went to therapy and worked on processing his childhood pain. He forgave his parents not because what they did was okay, but because holding the grudge was hurting him more than it was hurting them. Aaron moved forward. He took responsibility for his own life and his own healing. His parents had made mistakes, but those mistakes didn't have to define his future. Aaron learned that we all have painful pasts. But our past doesn't determine our future. We get to decide who we become.
