Iris had spent her entire life seeking external validation. She needed people to tell her she was good enough. She based her self-worth on others' opinions. She was devastated whenever someone criticized her or didn't approve of her. Iris reached a breaking point. She realized that if she was always seeking external validation, she would never be stable because other people's opinions constantly changed. She decided to build her own validation system. She set her own standards for herself. She became aware of her own strengths and her own worth. She learned to recognize her own good qualities without needing others to point them out. Iris became more confident and more at peace. She no longer needed constant reassurance. She still valued others' input, but she no longer depended on it for her sense of self. Iris learned that seeking external validation is a path to misery. The only approval that truly matters is our own. When we approve of ourselves, we're finally free.
