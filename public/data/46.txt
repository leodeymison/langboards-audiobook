James had a complicated relationship with his father. His father had always been cold and distant. He had never said "I love you." He had never shown affection. James had spent his entire life trying to earn his father's love and approval. Nothing James did was ever good enough. When James's father had a stroke that left him unable to speak, James was devastated. He realized he would never hear those words of approval and love that he had desperately wanted. But sitting by his father's bedside, James suddenly understood something. His father had loved him. His father had worked long hours to provide for the family. His father had worried constantly about James's safety and future. Love wasn't always expressed in words or affection. Sometimes it was expressed through sacrifice and protection. James held his father's hand and told him, "I know you love me. I have always known." His father cried silently. James spent his father's remaining years understanding him in a new way. When his father died, James was sad, but he was also at peace. He had finally received the understanding he needed, even though it came too late for words. James became a father himself, and he made sure to express his love to his children through both actions and words. He didn't want them to have to wonder if he loved them. James learned that understanding our parents' limitations and the ways they showed love, even imperfectly, is a gift we can give ourselves.
